## Introduction

Blazor is a framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET. It allows you to create rich, modern web UIs without having to write JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with Blazor, you need to have the .NET SDK installed. You can create a new Blazor WebAssembly project using the following command:

```bash
dotnet new blazorweb -o MyBlazorApp
